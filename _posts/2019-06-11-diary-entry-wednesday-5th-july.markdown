Dear diary, looks like my adventure with Magneto ends before it starts. Michael – CEO – came and told me that they want to try new platform – Shoplifter. This is some german E-commerce engine they want me to try out and learn. We’re about to get a partnership with Shoplifter so this sounds like a big deal for the company.

Also, Robson decided that I should do the interviews for new programmers since I have an experience in that area and having wider knowledge in technology itself I will be able to hire the most valuable ones.

All of this escalated pretty fast. All the appreciation is very exciting.
