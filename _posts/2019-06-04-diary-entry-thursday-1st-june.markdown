Dear diary. First day of my work at Timid Limited has finished. I must say that I wasn’t expecting what I experienced.

I was assigned to the Super-Phil team. After my first assignment was done, I send some code to review by my team leader. I was shocked when he asked me about why am I doing it. I was warned that many things are going differently here. And that programmers simply don’t do obvious things.

BUT NOT MAKING A CODE REVIEW?

OK. This is the first thing that must change. I’ll talk to team leader tomorrow in the morning. Maybe with CTO too. After all, Robson told me that he can’t wait to hear my opinion and ideas that may be good to introduce.

We’ll see.

P.S. Looks like that they don’t do unit tests either.
